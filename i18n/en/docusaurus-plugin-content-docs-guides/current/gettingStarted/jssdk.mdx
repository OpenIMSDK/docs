# oimws Deployment - Planned for Deprecation

## OpenIM's Two Versions of JSSDK

OpenIM provides two versions of its JSSDK, each tailored for different use cases and scenarios:

### 1. WASM Version

[Repository Link](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-sdk-web-wasm)

**Advantages**:

- **Superior Performance**: Built using WebAssembly (WASM), resulting in higher efficiency.
- **Local Message Storage**: Messages are stored locally, speeding up data processing.

**Disadvantages**:

- **Large File Size**: The package size is relatively large, approximately 20MB before compression.
- **Incompatible with Mini Programs**: Cannot be used in mini programs.

### 2. Pure JS Version

**Advantages**:

- **High Compatibility**: Does not depend on a specific tech stack, allowing it to be used in more environments and platforms.

**Disadvantages**:

- **Relatively Lower Performance**: Performance is affected as historical messages need to be fetched from the server.

## OIMWS Overview

OIMWS (OpenIM WebSocket) is a server-side solution specifically designed for OpenIM’s pure JS SDK. It handles all WebSocket requests coming from the JSSDK.

This guide will provide detailed instructions on how to install and run OIMWS, as well as a comprehensive explanation of its key features and configuration parameters.

## Installation

You can install the OIMWS SDK Server in two ways:

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**: Clone the [OIMWS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openimsdk/oimws) to your local environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/oimws
   ```

   After cloning, please read the README file.

## Running OIMWS

Before running the OIMWS SDK Server, ensure you have installed it correctly.

The program requires certain parameters to be configured. You can set these parameters via command-line flags. Below are the main functions and parameters:

```yaml
openimApi: 'http://127.0.0.1:10002'
openimWs: 'ws://127.0.0.1:10001'
sdkWsPort: [10003]
dbDir: '../../../../db/'
```

### Parameter Descriptions

1. **`openimApi`**: The OpenIM API listening address, defaulting to `http://127.0.0.1:10002`.
2. **`openimWs`**: The OpenIM WebSocket listening address, defaulting to `ws://127.0.0.1:10001`.
3. **`sdkWsPort`**: The port on which OpenIMSDK WebSocket listens, defaulting to `10003`.
4. **`dbDir`**: The directory for OpenIM’s database, defaulting to the `_output/db` folder in the current directory.

### Running Example

To modify these parameters from the command line, you can add flags to customize them. For instance:

```bash
# Compile the project
mage
# Run the project
mage start
```

This will start the server, using the specified parameters to configure the service.
