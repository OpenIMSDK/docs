# Monitoring System
This document introduces the deployment and use of Prometheus monitoring and alarm functions in Openim using binary and Docker methods,
Please refer to the link document for the monitoring and alarm usage of Openim deployed in k8s mode: https://github.com/openimsdk/helm-charts/blob/main/docs/user-guide-zh.md

## openim-server source code deployment method
The following is the steps of deploying Openim server in source code mode:
step1ÔºöClone the repository and switch to the release branch
            git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server && cd open-im-server
step2ÔºöSet common environment variables.
step3ÔºöDeploy components.
            make init && docker compose up -d.

To enable the monitoring function, we need to break down step 3 into three small steps: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
Step 3.1: Execute the "make init" command, open the generated config/config.yaml file, and modify it as follows: Prometheus. enable: true
:::tip
If you need to configure the alarm function, please rewrite alertmanager. yml, email. tmml, and instance down rules. yml in this step.
Please refer to the (Alarm System>Alarm Configuration File Description).
For the convenience of the experience, you may not rewrite the three configuration files for now.
:::
import Image40 from './assets/config1.png';
<img src={Image40} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```
Step 3.2: Modify the docker-compose.yml file to make the openim-admin management backend module and
the components required for monitoring alarms, such as Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and Node Exporter (optional) available
Step 3.3: Execute "docker-compose up-d" to install all monitoring components and management backend modules
:::tip
Since the openim admin management backend module uses the chat service module, you will need to install our additional chat module,
Please refer to:Quick Start>Source Code Deployment>AppServer(chat)

## openim-server docker deployment method
The following is the step-by-step process for Docker to deploy Openim Server:
step1ÔºöSet Common Environment Variables
step2ÔºöPull and Launch Image
            git clone https://github.com/openim-sigs/openim-docker openim/openim-docker && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim/openim-docker && make init && docker compose up -d
To enable the monitoring function, we need to break down step 2 into three small steps: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
Step 2.1: Execute the following command:
          git clone https://github.com/openim-sigs/openim-docker openim/openim-docker && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim/openim-docker && make init
          open the generated config/config.yaml file, and modify it as follows: Prometheus. enable: true
:::tip
If you need to configure the alarm function, please rewrite alertmanager. yml, email. tmml, and instance down rules. yml in this step.
Please refer to the (Alarm System>Alarm Configuration File Description).
For the convenience of the experience, you may not rewrite the three configuration files for now.

# Alarm system
The system has implemented two default alarm rules (instance_down, database_insert_failure-alerts) for email alarms,
You only need to modify the configuration information of the sending and receiving email addresses in the alertmanager.yml file under the config folder
to receive system alarm emails based on default rules
:::tip
If you want to implement alarm notifications through DingTalk, Enterprise WeChat, and other methods, you need to rewrite alertmanager. yml yourself,
refer to websiteÔºöhttps://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/
:::


## Alarm Configuration File Description
1ÔºåThe entire alarm has three configuration files, namely alertmanager.yml, email.tmpl, and instance-down-rules.yml, as shown in the following figure:
import Image15 from './assets/alert1.png';
<img src={Image15} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```
2ÔºåEmail Alert Architecture Description.
 The Prometheus component loads the alarm rule instance-down-rules.yml file and sends the alarm information to the alertmanager component,
 The alertmanager component loads alertmanager.yml and email.tmpl files, and sends emails through the configured alert email information and email template
import Image16 from './assets/alert2.png';
<img src={Image16} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```
3Ôºåinstance-down-rules.yml file description.
You can add your personal rules in instance-down-rules.yml file in bellow:
import Image17 from './assets/alert3.png';
<img src={Image17} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```
4Ôºåalertmanager.yml file description.
Please modify to your actual sending and receiving email configuration information to receive alarm messages:
import Image18 from './assets/alert4.png';
<img src={Image18} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```
5Ôºåemail.tmplfile description.
This file is in HTML format, and the alarm management module will fill in the variable information inside, then render it into an HTML format file for email sending.
You can rewrite the template file according to your own needs:
import Image19 from './assets/alert5.png';
<img src={Image19} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```


## Alarm deployment
The alarm module is deployed together with the monitoring module, and there is no separate deployment of alarm modules.
Please deploy monitoring steps (Monitoring System>Binary Deployment Openim Server Monitoring Deployment>Step 3.1; Monitoring System>Docker Deployment Openim Server Monitoring Deployment>Step 2.1) as needed
Rewrite the alertmanager. yml, email.tmpl, and instance down rules.yml files to meet your requirements,
During the experience phase, you only need to modify the configuration information of the sending and receiving email addresses in the alertmanager.yml
file to receive default system alarm emails, providing a quick experience


## Alarm experience
You can manually trigger the instancedown alarm rule, execute the "make stop" command to stop the openim server service,
wait for more than 5 minutes, and then receive the alarm email. The content is as follows:
import Image20 from './assets/alert6.png';
<img src={Image20} width="700" alt="PC Web Interface" />
```


# Logging system
If the Openim service is deployed through the help chart method in a k8s environment, the Loki logs can be viewed through Grafana, that is, the log information of all Openim services can be viewed through Grafana.

At present, there is no integrated Loki log collection component for source and Docker deployments. If you want to experience the Loki log collection function, please use the helm chart deployment in k8s system,

For details, please refer to the link https://github.com/openimsdk/helm-charts/blob/main/docs/user-guide-zh.md
