# üõ† Docker Deployment

## 1. Environment and Component Requirements
For server environment, system, and storage components, refer to [this document](./env-comp)

## 2. Docker Deployment

### 2.1 Clone the Repository and Initialize

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker openim-docker && cd openim-docker && make init
```
Tips
>To get **openim-docker** by downloading the tarball, you need to go to the **openim-docker/srcipts** directory and execute the following command **find . / -name "*.sh" | xargs chmod +x**

### 2.2 Set OPENIM_IP

```jsx
# If the server has an external IP
export OPENIM_IP="external IP"
# If only providing internal network service
export OPENIM_IP="internal IP"
```

### 2.3 Start Services and View Logs

```jsx
docker compose up -d
docker ps
docker compose logs -f openim-chat
docker compose logs -f openim-server
```

## 3. Quick Verification

Please refer to the [Quick Verification](./quickTestServer) document.

## 4. Admin Panel and Monitoring System

Please refer to the [Admin Panel and Monitoring System](./admin) document.

## 5. About Modifying Configuration Items

This project's configuration items are quite complex, primarily because some configurations involve multiple files such as **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**. The modification instructions are divided into two parts: shared configuration items and other configuration items.

### 5.1 Shared Configuration Items

Shared configuration items for **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

1. mysql/mongo/redis/kafka/zookeeper/minio ports and passwords;
2. SECRET;
3. API_OPENIM_PORT;
4. OPENIM_IP;
5. MINIO_PORT;
6. GRAFANA_PORT.

### 5.2 Modification Methods

For modifying shared configuration items in section 5.1, choose one of the two methods below.

Method One: Regenerate All Configurations

If a comprehensive update of configurations is needed, follow these steps:

1. Delete existing configuration files: delete **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`** files.
2. Modify `.env` file: update the related configuration items in the **`.env`** file.
3. Regenerate configurations and restart services: execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`**. This will regenerate configuration files based on new settings in the **`.env`** file and restart the services.

Method Two: Modify Multiple Configuration Files Separately

If only partial updates are needed, follow these steps:

1. Modify `.env` file: update the related configuration items in the **`.env`** file.
2. Manually update configuration files: according to the changes in the **`.env`** file, correspondingly update the configuration items in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`** and **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**.
3. Special handling for specific variables: if **`OPENIM_IP`**, **`API_OPENIM_PORT`**, **`MINIO_PORT`**, **`GRAFANA_PORT`** are modified, update the following configuration items in **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**:

    ```yaml
    object:
      apiURL: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$API_OPENIM_PORT"
      minio:
        endpoint: "http://$DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:$MINIO_PORT"
        signEndpoint: "http://$OPENIM_IP:$MINIO_PORT"
    
    grafanaUrl: http://$OPENIM_IP:$GRAFANA_PORT
    ```
    
4. Restart services: execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`** to apply changes and restart services.

### 5.3 Modifying Other Configuration Items

For non-shared variables in **`.env`**, **`openim-chat/config/config.yaml`**, and **`openim-server/config/config.yaml`**, these configuration items can be modified individually in the respective files. Execute **`docker compose down ; docker compose up -d`** to apply changes and restart services.

## ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions** üßê

### 1. About Docker Version üêã

The newer version of Docker has integrated docker-compose. Older versions of Docker may not support the gateway feature‚ùå. We recommend upgrading to a newer version, such as `23.0.1`üîù
