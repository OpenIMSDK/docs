## 🚀 2. Pull and Launch Image

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openim-sigs/openim-docker openim/openim-docker && export openim=$(pwd)/openim && cd $openim/openim-docker && make init && docker compose up -d
```

🟢 If your docker doesn't support compose, it's recommended to upgrade following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

### 📜 View Logs

```bash
docker compose logs openim-server
docker compose logs openim-chat
```

🟢 More logs can be found at: `openim-server/branch/logs/` and `openim-chat/branch/logs`

### 1. How to modify using external components? 🛠️

**Example: Using external mysql🔗:**

- 📝 Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and comment out mysql configuration and its corresponding depends_on.

### 2. Health status is `starting`? 🟠

Initially, before the health check, Docker's default status is `starting`⏳. Approximately after 1 minute, the status changes to `healthy`✅.

---

### 3. Port Mapping 🌐

Docker networks allow for user-defined settings🔧. You can map ports as usual🔀.

---
