# Our Mission

From the day **OpenIM** was founded, we have always believed in "open source" as the core driving force. This not only reflects the internet's ideals of freedom, equality, and sharing but also addresses global data security challenges.

Issues such as data breaches, ransomware, and privacy invasions constantly remind us of the importance of security. Therefore, we offer a cost-effective and secure IM service to meet the data protection needs of enterprises.

> ⭐️ We thank every developer who has given us a thumbs up. Your support is the cornerstone of our pursuit to be the number one in open-source IM!
