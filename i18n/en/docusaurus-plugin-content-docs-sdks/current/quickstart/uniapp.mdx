## 🚀 Usage Demo
> Note: Demo is only used to demonstrate the introduction and use of the SDK, and is not a complete application.

We strongly recommend that you first run the framework-related examples we have prepared for you [DEMO](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-uniapp-demo). This will not only allow you to intuitively experience the functionality of OpenIMSDK but also help you quickly identify and resolve issues during the actual integration process.

## ❗️Common Questions

### 1. Developing Only H5 and Mini Programs

- If you are not developing for the App platform, use the [JSSDK](/sdks/quickstart/miniProgram) for H5 and Mini Program development. ***No need*** to follow the steps below.

### 2. Using Uni for Multi-Platform Development (APP, H5, Mini Programs)

- To run on iOS and Android, it is ***mandatory*** to install native plugins. The middle layer `openim-uniapp-polyfill` combines App native plugins and JSSDK capabilities, enabling unified development across APP, H5, and Mini Programs with the same codebase (SDK and im-server version >= 3.8.2).

### 3. About Dependencies

- **@openim/client-sdk**: JSSDK, required for running H5 and Mini Programs.

- **App native language plugins**: Required for running on iOS and Android.

- **openim-uniapp-polyfill**: Mandatory. It encapsulates JSSDK and native plugins, enabling unified development across multiple platforms.

## ⚙️ Integration Steps

### 1. Add Dependencies

- Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install openim-uniapp-polyfill @openim/client-sdk
```

- [dcloud Plugins Market](https://ext.dcloud.net.cn/plugin?id=6577) Select the appropriate project and package name to import the SDK

![uni_import](./assets/uni_import.png)

- Open the `manifest.json` file in the root directory of the imported SDK project, select **App Native Plugin Configuration**, and import the cloud plugin.

![uni_import_manifest](./assets/uni_import_manifest.png)

### 2. Import in Project (Pure APP Project)

```javascript
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

IMSDK.asyncApi('login', IMSDK.uuid(), {
  userID: '123',
  token: 'token',
});

const onConnectSuccess = () => {
  // Connection successful
};
// Set up listener
IMSDK.subscribe(IMSDK.IMEvents.OnConnectSuccess, onConnectSuccess);
// Unsubscribe listener
IMSDK.unsubscribe(IMSDK.IMEvents.OnConnectSuccess, onConnectSuccess);
```

### 3. Import in Project (APP、H5、Mini Program Project)

- Note 1: Use uniapp's method to call listeners, passing in methods from `IMSDK.IMEvents`, as there is a difference in case sensitivity between JSSDK and APP. This conversion is already handled in the npm package.

- Note 2: In some APIs, there may be differences between platforms due to platform support. When using them, check the documentation for the respective platform's API and note the differences:
  - Depending on the platform, pass the correct `platformID`.
  - Login API parameters may vary.
  - On APP you need to [initSDK](/sdks/api/initialization/initSDK) before using it.
  - Creating image and file messages uses different APIs, so use **conditional compilation** to call different methods.
  - And so on...

#### 3.1 Usage in Cross-Platform Scenarios

> Method 1: If parameters and method names are consistent across platforms, use uniapp's method to call them.

- This is a multi-platform compatible approach. In cross-platform scenarios, check if the API return content structure is consistent.

```javascript
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

IMSDK.asyncApi('createTextMessage', IMSDK.uuid(), 'text')
  .then((data) => {
    // do something
  })
```

> Method 2: If parameters and method names differ across platforms, use [conditional compilation](https://uniapp.dcloud.net.cn/tutorial/platform.html) to handle significant parameter differences.

```javascript
import IMSDK from 'openim-uniapp-polyfill';

// #ifdef H5 || MP-WEIXIN
IMSDK.asyncApi('login', IMSDK.uuid(), {
  userID : '123',
  token: 'token',
  platformID: 5,
  wsAddr: 'ws://your-server-ip:10001',
  apiAddr: 'http://your-server-ip:10002',
});
// #endif

// #ifdef APP-PLUS
IMSDK.asyncApi('login', IMSDK.uuid(), {
  userID: '123',
  token: 'token',
});
// #endif
```

### 4. 🛠️ Local Development

#### 4.1 Create Custom Debug Base

> Note: The package name needs to match the package name set when importing cloud plugins in the first step.

![uni_build](./assets/uni_build.png)

#### 4.2. Run on Custom Debug Base (iOS Only Supports Real Device Debugging)

> When debugging the APP side locally, you must package a custom base and start debugging on it.

![uni_run](./assets/uni_run.png)

### 5. 🚀 Build and Release

> For APP platform packaging and release, use Release -> Native APP Cloud Packaging.
