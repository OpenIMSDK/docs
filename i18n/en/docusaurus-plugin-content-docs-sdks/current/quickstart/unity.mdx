## ðŸš€ Usage Demo
We strongly recommend running the framework-related example [DEMO](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-unity-demo.git) prepared for you first. This will not only allow you to experience the functionality of OpenIMSDK intuitively but also help you quickly locate and resolve issues during the actual integration process.

## Integration Steps

1. **Create Unity Project**: Start by creating a new Unity project. Then, clone [open-im-sdk-unity](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-sdk-unity.git) into the `Assets` directory.

2. **Import Namespace**: Import the necessary namespace in your scripts:

    ```csharp
    using OpenIM.IMSDK.Unity;
    using OpenIM.IMSDK.Unity.Listener;
    ```

3. **Initialize SDK**:
   Initialize the OpenIMSDK by calling the `InitSDK` method:

    ```csharp
    var suc = IMSDK.InitSDK(IMConfig config, IConnCallBack connCallBack);
    ```

4. **Set Listeners**:
   Set up listeners for various events:

    ```csharp
    // Conversation listener
    IMSDK.SetConversationListener(conversation);
    // Friendship listener
    IMSDK.SetFriendShipListener(friendship);
    // Group listener
    IMSDK.SetGroupListener(group);
    ```

5. **Login**:
   Before logging in, make sure to set up the listeners. Then, initiate the login process:

    ```csharp
    IMSDK.Login((suc,errCode,errMsg)=>{

    },string uid, string token);
    ```

6. **Logout**:
   Perform logout when necessary:

    ```csharp
    IMSDK.Logout((suc,errCode,errMsg)=>{

    });
    ```

7. **Quit**:
   When closing your application, make sure to release SDK resources:

    ```csharp
    IMSDK.UnInitSDK();
    ```
    
These steps should guide you through the process of integrating OpenIMSDK into your Unity project seamlessly.
