The `logLevel` indicates the severity of the logs: when `logLevel` is 6, it prints Debug logs with SQL statements; when `logLevel` is 5, it prints Debug logs; when `logLevel` is 4, it prints Info logs; when `logLevel` is 3, it prints Warn logs; and when `logLevel` is 2, it prints Error logs.  
The `file` parameter refers to the relative path of the file where the log printing interface is called, `line` indicates the specific line number in the file, `msg` is a custom description of the current log, `err` is the expected error to be passed in, and `keyAndValues` contains key-value pairs describing additional fields to be printed along with their values.
