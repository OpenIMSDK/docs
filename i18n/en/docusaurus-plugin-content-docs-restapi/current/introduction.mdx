# 📞 Callback Explanation

📢 **OpenIM** provides a powerful callback function. When a specific event occurs, before or after, **OpenIMServer** proactively notifies the APP business server through HTTP/HTTPS requests. Thus, the APP business server can intervene in the subsequent process of the event or perform data synchronization based on these callbacks.

## 📑 Callback Classification

Callbacks are classified into two main categories based on the timing of processing:

- 🚫 **Callbacks before an event occurs**: These callbacks (before type) aim to let the APP business server intervene in event processing, for example, to filter sensitive words in messages. **OpenIMServer** will determine the subsequent process based on the callback return.

- 📤 **Notifications after an event occurs**: These callbacks (after type) are mainly used to notify the APP business server to synchronize data, for example, when a user joins a group. At this time, **OpenIMServer** will ignore the callback return and error codes.

## ⚙️ Configuration Explanation

```yaml
callback:
  url:
  beforeCreateGroup:
    enable: true
    timeout: 5
    failedContinue: true

```
- url: The callback address of the APP business server, supporting HTTP/HTTPS.
- enable: Whether to enable this callback, true for enabled.
- timeout: Response timeout time (seconds).
- failedContinue: Whether to continue the process after timeout or API failure, generally only valid for before type callbacks, true for continuing the process.

## 🔄 Callback Protocol

**OpenIMServer** uses a third-party callback mechanism based on the **HTTP/HTTPS** protocol. When initiating callback requests, **OpenIMServer** uses the **POST** request method to notify the APP business server. The specific content of these requests will be directly included in the request body.
