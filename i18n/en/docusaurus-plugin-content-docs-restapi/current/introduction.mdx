# OpenIM Server APIs

## 🚀 REST API

OpenIM Server offers **REST APIs** for business systems to enhance their functionalities, such as:

- 🛠 Creating groups
- 📬 Pushing messages

For more functionalities, refer to the API documentation provided later.

> ⚠️ **Note**: To call the **REST APIs**, you need to act as an **APP Administrator**, which is provided over port `10002`. An **APP Administrator** refers to a user with super privileges. OpenIM Server comes with a built-in APP Administrator whose userID is imAdmin.


Before starting to call APIs, it is necessary first to obtain an admin token using the secret through the [get admin token](./apis/authenticationManagement/getAdminToken) API. For the [import user](./apis/userManagement/userRegister) interface, secret verification is also required.

## 🔗 Webhooks

OpenIM Server also provides powerful callback functionalities to meet more business needs. A **callback** is defined as a request sent by OpenIM Server to the business server before or after certain events occur, such as:

- 📤 Callback before sending a message
- 📥 Callback after sending a message
