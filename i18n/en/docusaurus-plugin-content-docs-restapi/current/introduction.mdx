# OpenIM Server APIs

## 🚀 REST API

OpenIM Server offers a **REST API** for integration with business systems to enhance functionality. Examples include:

- 🛠 Creating groups
- 📬 Sending messages

For more details, refer to the API documentation.

> ⚠️ **Note**:
> In the request URL, `{API_ADDRESS}` refers to the host address where OpenIM Server is deployed, e.g., `http://IP:10002`.
>
> To call the **REST API**, you need to use an **APP Administrator** account. This service is accessible via port `10002`. An **APP Administrator** is a user with super admin privileges. OpenIM Server includes a built-in APP Administrator with the userID `imAdmin`.
>
> All `array` parameters in the `API` request have a maximum length limit of `1000`.
>
> **API Authentication Process:**
>
> 1. Use the [`user_token API`](./apis/authenticationManagement/getAdminToken) to retrieve the admin token.
> 2. Use the admin token to call other APIs.
>
> All `array` parameters in the `API` request have a maximum length limit of `1000`.

## 🔗 Webhooks

OpenIM Server also offers powerful callback functionality to accommodate various business needs. A **webhook** triggers an outbound request to the business server when certain events occur, either before or after processing. Examples include:

- 📤 Pre-message send callback
- 📥 Post-message send callback

> In the request URL, `{WEBHOOK_ADDRESS}` refers to the host address where `webhook` is deployed.
