# User Offline Status Callback

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to change the user's status to offline.

## Notes
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. For configuration methods, see the [Callback Description](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server needs to verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is their own SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- When a user initiates a logout request to go offline through the client.
- When the user's client experiences a disconnection.
- When a user actively kills the client process, or if the process is killed by the mobile operating system when the app is in the background, or if the process exits abnormally due to a crash.
- Client heartbeat timeout, such as when the network is turned off, or completely unavailable.

## Timing of Callback
- When a user goes offline, either actively or passively.
