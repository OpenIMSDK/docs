# Callback Before Setting Friend Remark

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive requests from users to set remarks for friends. Additionally, the business server can refuse the user's setting request or modify and intervene in the remark content.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIMServer to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users set a friend's remark through the client.

## Timing of the Callback
- Before OpenIMServer prepares to process the request to set a friend's remark.
