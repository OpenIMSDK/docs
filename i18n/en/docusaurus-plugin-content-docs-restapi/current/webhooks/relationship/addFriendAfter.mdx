# Callback After Agreeing to Add a Friend

## Function Description
The App backend can use this callback to real-time monitor the addition of new friends by users.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users agree to add someone as a friend after receiving a friend request.

## Timing of the Callback
- Triggered after OpenIM Server successfully adds a friend.
