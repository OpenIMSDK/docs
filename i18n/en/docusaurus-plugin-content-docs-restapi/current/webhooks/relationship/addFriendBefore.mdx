# Callback Before Adding a Friend

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive user requests for adding friends, including:
- Real-time monitoring of friend request submissions.
- Intercepting malicious friend requests.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIMServer to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users send friend requests through the client, asking to add friends.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIMServer receives a friend request from the APP.
