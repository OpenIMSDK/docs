# Callback After Importing Friends

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive requests from users importing friends. The business server can refuse user requests to import friends, or modify and intervene in the requests.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIMServer to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users import friends through the client.
- App administrators import friends through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- Before OpenIMServer prepares to import friends.
