# Callback for Adding a User to the Blacklist

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive requests from users who are attempting to add other users to their blacklist. The business server can review or modify these requests as needed.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIMServer to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users try to add other users to the blacklist through the client.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIMServer receives a request to add a user to the blacklist, but before processing the request.
