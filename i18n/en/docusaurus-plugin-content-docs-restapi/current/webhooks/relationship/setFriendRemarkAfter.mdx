# Callback After Setting Friend Remark

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to obtain the result of the user setting a friend's remark. The backend can use this information for data synchronization and other operations.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users set a friend's remark through the client.
- App administrators set a friend's remark through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server processes the request to set a friend's remark.
