# Callback for Removing a User from the Blacklist

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to process user requests for removing someone from the blacklist. This includes real-time recording of users leaving the blacklist (e.g., logging or syncing to other systems).

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users try to remove other users from the blacklist through the client.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server receives a request to remove a user from the blacklist, but before processing the request.
