# Callback After Kicking Group Members

## Description
The App business server can use this callback to handle group administrator requests to remove members from a group. This enables real-time tracking of users being removed (e.g., logging the action or syncing to other systems).

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- A group administrator or owner attempts to remove one or more members from the group via the client.

## Timing of Callback
- The callback is triggered after OpenIM Server receives the request to remove members from the group and before it processes the request.
