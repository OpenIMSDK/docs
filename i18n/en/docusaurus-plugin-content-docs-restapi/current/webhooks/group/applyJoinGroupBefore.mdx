# Callback Before a User Joins a Group

## Function Description
The App business server can view requests from users applying to join groups in real-time through this callback. This includes the ability of the App backend to intercept user requests to join groups.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, a callback URL must be configured, and the switch corresponding to this callback protocol must be turned on. For configuration methods, refer to the [Callback Description](../introduction) document.
- The callback direction is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- The App business server, upon receiving the callback request, needs to verify if the command parameter in the request URL is their SDK parameter.
- The APP business server needs to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users initiate a request to join a group through the client.

## Timing of the Callback
- The callback occurs before OpenIM Server prepares to add a user to a group (if administrator approval is required, then before notifying the administrator).
