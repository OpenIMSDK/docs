# Callback Before Applying to Join Group

## Description
The App’s business server can use this callback to monitor and manage users' requests to join groups in real time, including intercepting join requests if needed.

## Important Notes
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and turn on the switch for this specific callback protocol. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- When a user sends a request to join a group from the client.

## Timing of Callback
- OpenIM Server triggers this callback **before** adding the user to the group (if admin approval is required, it will trigger the callback **before** notifying the administrator).
