# Callback After Dissolving a Group

## Function Description
The App business server can receive information about the dissolution of a group through this callback, including real-time recording of the group's dissolution (such as logging or synchronizing with other systems).

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and activate the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. See the [Callback Description](../introduction) document for configuration methods.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- The App business server needs to verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its own SDKNAME parameter after receiving the callback request.
- The APP business server is required to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users dissolve a group through the client.
- App administrators dissolve a group through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- After the group is dissolved.
