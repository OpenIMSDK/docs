# Callback After Group Dissolution

## Description
The Appâ€™s business server can use this callback to receive information on group dissolutions, enabling it to record such events in real-time (e.g., logging or syncing with other systems).

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- Group dissolution initiated by an App user through the client.
- Group dissolution initiated by an App admin via REST API.

## Timing of Callback
- Triggered **after** the group is dissolved.
