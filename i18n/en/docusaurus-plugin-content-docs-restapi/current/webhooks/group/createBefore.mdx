# Callback Before Group Creation

## Description
The App’s business server can use this callback to review requests from users to create groups. The server can either allow the request, reject it, or modify it as needed.

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- Group creation requests from an App user through the client.
- Group creation requests from an App admin via REST API.

## Timing of Callback
- Triggered **before** the OpenIM Server prepares to create the group.
