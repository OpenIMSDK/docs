# Callback After New Member Joins Group

## Description
The App business server can use this callback to monitor real-time updates when a new member joins a group, enabling necessary data synchronization on the App's backend.

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- An App user applies and is approved to join a group.
- An App user successfully invites another user to join a group.
- An App administrator adds a user to a group through the REST API.

## Timing of Callback
- After a userâ€™s request to join a group is approved.
- After a user is invited by another member and successfully joins a group.
- After a user is added to the group by an administrator through the REST API.
