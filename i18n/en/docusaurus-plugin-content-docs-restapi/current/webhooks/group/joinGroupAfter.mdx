# Callback After a User Joins a Group

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to real-time monitor messages about group members joining, including notifying the App backend about member joining. The App can use this for necessary data synchronization.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and activate the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. See the [Callback Description](../introduction) document for configuration methods.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIMServer to the App backend.
- The App business server needs to verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its own SDK parameter after receiving the callback request.
- The APP business server is required to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users apply to join a group through the client and get approved.
- App users successfully add other people to a group through the client.
- App administrators add users to a group through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- After a user actively applies and successfully joins a group.
- After a user is invited by other members and successfully joins a group.
- After a user is added to the group by administrators through the REST API.
