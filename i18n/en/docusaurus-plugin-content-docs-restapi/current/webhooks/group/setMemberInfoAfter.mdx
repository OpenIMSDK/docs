# Callback After Setting Group Member Information

## Description
The App backend can use this callback to retrieve requests for setting group member information, allowing the App to perform necessary data synchronization.

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, see the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback direction is from OpenIMServer to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the specified timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- A group administrator successfully modifies group member-related information through the client.

## Timing of Callback
- After OpenIMServer updates group member information.
