# Callback for Kicking Out Group Members

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to handle requests from group administrators to kick out members, including real-time recording of members leaving the group (such as logging or synchronizing with other systems).

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and activate the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. See the [Callback Description](../introduction) document for configuration methods.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- The App business server needs to verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its own SDKNAME parameter after receiving the callback request.
- The APP business server is required to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- Group administrators or owners attempt to kick out one or more group members through the client.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server receives a request to kick out group members and before processing the request.
