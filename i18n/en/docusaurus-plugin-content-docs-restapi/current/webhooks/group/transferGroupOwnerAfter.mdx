# Callback After Transferring Group Ownership

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive information about the transfer of group ownership. The business server can then perform subsequent processing or recordkeeping for the transferred group.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIMServer to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users or administrators transfer group ownership through the client or API interface.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIMServer successfully transfers the ownership of the group.
