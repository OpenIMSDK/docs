# Callback Before Users Join a Group

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to real-time monitor group members' requests to add other users to the group, including the ability for the App backend to intercept users' applications to join a group.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and activate the switch corresponding to this callback protocol. See the [Callback Description](../introduction) document for configuration methods.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- The App business server needs to verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its own SDK parameter after receiving the callback request.
- The APP business server is required to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users initiate a request through the client to add other users to a group.
- App administrators add users to a group through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- The callback occurs before OpenIM Server prepares to add users to a group (if relationship chain hosting exists and the App has configured friend relationship verification in the instant messaging IM, the callback occurs after the verification is passed).
