# Callback Before Inviting New Members to Group

## Description
The App business server can use this callback to monitor requests from group members to invite other users to join a group. The server can intercept and review these requests.

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- An App user initiates a request to invite another user to a group through the client.
- An App administrator adds a user to a group through the REST API.

## Timing of Callback
- The callback is triggered **before** OpenIM Server proceeds with adding the user to the group.
