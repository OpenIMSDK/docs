# Callback Before Setting Group Member Information

## Description
The App backend can use this callback to review the updated group member information before changes are applied. This allows the backend to review or modify the request before the information is actually updated.

## Important Notes
- To enable this callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For configuration details, see the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback direction is from OpenIMServer to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the specified timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- A group administrator modifies group member-related information through the client.

## Timing of Callback
- Before OpenIMServer updates the group member information.
