# Callback Before Member Joins Group

## Description

The App business server can use this callback to monitor information when a member attempts to join a group, including intercepting user profile data such as avatar, nickname, user permissions, and additional information before they join.

## Important Notes

- To enable the callback, configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding protocol switch. For details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the specified timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback

- The group owner initiates the creation of a group chat via the App client.
- The App administrator invites users to a group through the REST API.
- The App administrator processes group join requests via the REST API.
- A user joins a group via the App.

## Timing of Callback

- Before OpenIM Server prepares to create the group chat.
- Before OpenIM Server approves a user joining the group.
