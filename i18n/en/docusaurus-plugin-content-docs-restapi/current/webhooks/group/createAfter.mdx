# Callback After Group Creation

## Description
The App’s business server can use this callback to monitor information about newly created groups in real time, including notifications to the App backend that a group was created successfully. This allows the backend to perform data synchronization and other operations.

## Important Notes
- To enable the callback, you must configure the callback URL and turn on the switch for this specific callback protocol. For configuration details, refer to the [Callback Introduction](../introduction) document.
- The callback is initiated from the OpenIM Server to the App backend as an HTTP/HTTPS POST request.
- The App business server must respond within the timeout period.

## Scenarios that Trigger This Callback
- Successful group creation by an App user through the client.
- Successful group creation by an App admin via REST API.

## Timing of Callback
- Triggered **after** the OpenIM Server successfully creates a group.
