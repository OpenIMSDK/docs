# Callback After Creating a Group

## Function Description
The App business server can view information about user-created groups in real-time through this callback. This includes notifying the App backend of successful group creations, allowing for data synchronization and other operations.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, a callback URL must be configured, and the switch corresponding to this callback protocol must be turned on. For configuration methods, refer to the [Callback Description](../introduction) document.
- The callback direction is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- The App business server, upon receiving the callback request, needs to verify if the command parameter in the request URL is their SDK parameter.
- The APP business server needs to respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users successfully create a group through the client.
- App administrators successfully create a group through the REST API.

## Timing of the Callback
- After OpenIM Server successfully creates a group.
