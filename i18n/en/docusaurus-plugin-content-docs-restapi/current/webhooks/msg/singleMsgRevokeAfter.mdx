# Callback for Single Chat Message Revocation

## Function Description
The App business server can use this callback to receive requests for users retracting single chat messages.

## Precautions
- To enable the callback, it is necessary to configure the callback URL and activate the corresponding switch for this callback protocol. Configuration methods can be found in the [Callback Explanation](../introduction) document.
- The direction of the callback is an HTTP/HTTPS POST request initiated by OpenIM Server to the App backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the App business server must verify whether the command parameter in the request URL is its SDKNAME parameter.
- The APP business server must respond to this request within the timeout period.

## Scenarios That May Trigger This Callback
- App users retract single chat messages through the client.
- App administrators retract single chat messages through the REST API admin_msgwithdraw interface.

## Timing of the Callback
- After the single chat message is successfully retracted.
