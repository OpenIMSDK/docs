# OpenIM Mac Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide provides detailed instructions for deploying OpenIM on Mac, including both source code and Docker deployment methods.

## Preliminary Environment Setup

Before initiating the deployment process, ensure a clean working environment:

1. **New Directory**: It's recommended to start in a fresh directory to avoid conflicts.
2. **Process Check**: Run the following commands to ensure no conflicting processes are running:
   - `ps -ef | grep openim`
   - `ps -ef | grep chat`
3. **Docker Container Check**: Use `docker ps` to verify the absence of any related containers.

## Source Code Deployment

### Deploying openim-server

Deploying from source can be slightly more complex due to differences in Docker's network configurations between Mac and Linux.

1. **Cloning and Preparing the Repository**:
   ```jsx
   git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server
   cd open-im-server
   export OPENIM_IP="Your IP" # Optional for cloud servers
   make init # Generate configuration files
   ```

2. **Configuring Kafka Logic**: Modify the `docker-compose.yml` file, specifically the Kafka settings:
   - Original:
     ```jsx
     - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,EXTERNAL://${DOCKER_BRIDGE_GATEWAY:-172.28.0.1}:${KAFKA_PORT:-19094}
     ```
   - Updated:
     ```jsx
     - KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,EXTERNAL://127.0.0.1:${KAFKA_PORT:-19094}
     ```

3. **Starting the Service**:
   ```jsx
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Final Configurations**: Modify `config/config.yaml` to replace all instances of `172.28.0.1` with `127.0.0.1`:
   ```jsx
   vim config/config.yaml -c "%s/172\.28\.0\.1/127.0.0.1/g" -c "wq"
   ```

5. **Launching openim-server**:
   ```jsx
   make start
   ```

6. **Verification**: Check the service status:
   ```jsx
   make check
   ```
   ⚠️ **Note**: It's best to wait five minutes before performing the check to avoid any false negatives.

### Deploying openim-chat

There are several methods to deploy openim-chat, including source code and Docker.

1. **Returning to the Parent Directory**:
   ```jsx
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Source Code Deployment**:
   ```jsx
   git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/chat
   cd chat
   make init # Generate configuration files
   ```

3. **Setting Up MySQL**: If MySQL is not already deployed, follow these steps:
   ```jsx
   docker run -d \
     --name mysql \
     -p 13306:3306 \
     -p 3306:33060 \
     -v "$(pwd)/components/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql" \
     -v "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime" \
     -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="openIM123" \
     --restart always \
     mariadb:10.6
   ```

4. **Configuring openim-chat**: Modify `config/config.yaml` as before, replacing `172.28.0.1` with `127.0.0.1`.

5. **Starting openim-chat**:
   ```jsx
   make start
   ```

6. **Verification**: Check for the following processes to confirm successful launch:
   ```jsx
   ➜  chat git:(main) ✗ ps -ef | grep chat
   ```

7. **Accessing the Web Interface**: Navigate to `http://ip:11001` in your browser.

## Docker Deployment

For deploying OpenIM using Docker, refer to the instructions provided at [OpenIM Docker GitHub Repository](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker). Follow the steps outlined there for a seamless Docker-based deployment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-docker
cd openim-docker
export OPENIM_IP="Your IP"
make init
docker compose up -d 
docker compose logs -f openim-server
docker compose logs -f openim-chat
```
